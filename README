DESCRIPTION
    The "Test::Tech" module extends the capabilities of the "Test" module.

    The design is simple. The "Test::Tech" module loads the "Test" module
    without exporting any "Test" subroutines into the "Test::Tech"
    namespace. There is a "Test::Tech" cover subroutine with the same name
    for each "Test" module subroutine. Each "Test::Tech" cover subroutine
    will call the &Test::$subroutine before or after it adds any additional
    capabilities. The "Test::Tech" module procedural (subroutine) interface
    is a drop-in for the "Test" module.

    The "Test::Tech" has a hybrid interface. The subroutine/methods that use
    object data are the 'new', 'ok', 'skip', 'skip_tests', 'tech_config' and
    'finish' subroutines/methods.

    When the module is loaded it creates a default object. If any of the
    above subroutines/methods are used procedurally, without a class or
    object, the subroutine/method will use the default method.

    The "Test::Tech" module extends the capabilities of the "Test" module as
    follows:

    *   Compare almost any data structure by passing variables through the
        Data::Secs2::stringify() subroutine before making the comparision

    *   Method to skip the rest of the tests, with a $dianostic input, upon
        a critical failure.

    *   Adds addition $name, [@option], {@option} inputs to the ok and skip
        subroutines. The $name input is print as "ok $test_num - $name" or
        "not ok $test_num - $name".

    *   Method to generate demos that appear as an interactive session using
        the methods under test

  plan subroutine

     $success = plan(@args);

    The *plan* subroutine is a cover method for &Test::plan. The *@args* are
    passed unchanged to &Test::plan. All arguments are options. Valid
    options are as follows:

    tests
        The number of tests. For example

         tests => 14,

    todo
        An array of test that will fail. For example

         todo => [3,4]

    onfail
        A subroutine that the *Test* module will execute on a failure. For
        example,

         onfail => sub { warn "CALL 911!" } 

  ok subroutine

     $test_ok = ok($actual_results, $expected_results, $diagnostic, $test_name, [@options]);
     $test_ok = ok($actual_results, $expected_results, $diagnostic, $test_name, {@options});

    The $diagnostic, $test_name, [@options], and {@options} inputs are
    optional. The $actual_results and $expected_results inputs may be
    references to any type of data structures. The @options is a hash input
    that will process the 'diagnostic' key the same as the $diagnostic input
    and the 'name' key the same as the $test_name input.

    The *ok* method is a cover function for the &Test::ok subroutine that
    extends the &Test::ok routine as follows:

    *   Prints out the *$test_name* to provide an English identification of
        the test. The $test_name appears as either "ok $test_num - $name" or
        "not ok $test_num - $name".

    *   The *ok* subroutine passes referenced inputs *$actual_results* and
        *$expectet_results* through Data::Secs2::stringify() subroutine. The
        *ok* method then uses &Test::ok to compare the text results from
        Data::Secs2::stringify() subroutine.

    *   The *ok* subroutine method passes variables that are not a reference
        directly to &Test::ok unchanged.

    *   Responses to a flag set by the skip_tests subroutine subroutine and
        skips the test completely.

  skip subroutine

     $test_ok = skip($actual_results, $expected_results, $diagnostic $test_name, [@options]);
     $test_ok = skip($actual_results, $expected_results, $diagnostic $test_name, {@options});

    The $diagnostic, $test_name, [@options], and {@options} inputs are
    optional. The $actual_results and $expected_results inputs may be
    references to any type of data structures. The @options is a hash input
    that will process the 'diagnostic' key the same as the $diagnostic input
    and the 'name' key the same as the $test_name input.

    The *skip* subroutine is a cover function for the &Test::skip subroutine
    that extends the &Test::skip the same as the ok subroutine subroutine
    extends the *&Test::ok* subroutine.

  skip_tests method

     $state = skip_tests( $on_off );
     $state = skip_tests( );

    The *skip_tests* subroutine sets a flag that causes the *ok* and the
    *skip* methods to skip testing.

  stringify subroutine

     $string = stringify( $var );

    The *stringify* subroutine will stringify *$var* using the
    "Data::Secs2::stringify subroutine" module only if *$var* is a
    reference; otherwise, it leaves it unchanged.

  tech_config subroutine

     $old_value = tech_config( $dot_index, $new_value );

    The *tech_config* subroutine reads and writes the below configuration
    variables

     dot index              contents           mode
     --------------------   --------------     --------
     Test.ntest             $Test::ntest       read only 
     Test.TESTOUT           $Test::TESTOUT     read write
     Test.TestLevel         $Test::TestLevel   read write
     Test.ONFAIL            $Test::ONFAIL      read write
     Test.TESTERR           $Test::TESTERR     read write
     Skip_Tests             # boolean          read write
 
    The *tech_config* subroutine always returns the *$old_value* of
    *$dot_index* and only writes the contents if *$new_value* is defined.

    The 'SCALAR' and 'ARRAY' references are transparent. The *tech_config*
    subroutine, when it senses that the *$dot_index* is for a 'SCALAR' and
    'ARRAY' reference, will read or write the contents instead of the
    reference.

    The The *tech_config* subroutine will read 'HASH" references but will
    never change them.

    The variables for the top level 'Dumper' *$dot_index* are established by
    "Data::Dumper" module; for the top level 'Test', the "Test" module.

  finish subroutine

     (@stats) = $tech->finish( );
     $num_passed = $tech->finish( );

    The "finish()" subroutine/method restores changes made to the "Test"
    module module made by the "tech_config" subroutine/method or directly.

    When the "new" subroutine/method creates a "Test::Tech" object. Perl
    will automatically run the "finish()" method when that object is
    destoried.

    Running the 'finish' method without a class or object, restores the
    'Test' module to the values when the 'Test::Tech' module was loaded.

    When used in an array context the "finish()" subroutine/method returns
    the "@stats" array. The "@stats" array consists of the following:

    The "finish()" subroutine resets the "last_test" and to zero and will
    returns undef without performing any of the above. The "finish()"
    subroutine will not be active again until a new test run is start with
    "&Test::Tech::plan" and the first test performed by "&Test::Tech::ok" or
    "&Test::Tech::skip".

    In a scalar contents, the "finish()" subroutine/method outputs a 1 for
    sucess and 0 for failure. In an array context, the "finish()"
    subroutine/method outputs "@stats" array that consists of the following:

    0   number of tests

        This is calculated as the maximum of the tests planned and the
        highest test number. From the maximum, substract the skipped tests.
        In other words, the sum of the missed, passed and failed test steps.

    1   reference to the unplanned test steps

    2   reference to the missed test steps

    3   reference to the skipped test steps

    4   reference to the passed test steps

    5   reference to the failed test steps

  demo subroutine

     demo($quoted_expression, @expression)

    The demo subroutine/method provides a session like out. The
    '$quoted_express' is printed out as typed in from the keyboard. The
    '@expression' is executed and printed out as the results of
    '$quoted_expression'.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
    Running the test script 'Tech.t' found in the
    "Test-Tech-$VERSION.tar.gz" distribution file verifies the requirements
    for this module.

    All testing software and documentation stems from the Software Test
    Description (STD) program module 't::Test::Tech::Tech', found in the
    distribution file "Test-Tech-$VERSION.tar.gz".

    The 't::Test::Tech::Tech' STD POD contains a tracebility matix between
    the requirements established above for this module, and the test steps
    identified by a 'ok' number from running the 'Tech.t' test script.

    The t::Test::Tech::Tech' STD program module '__DATA__' section contains
    the data to perform the following:

    *   to generate the test script 'Tech.t'

    *   generate the tailored STD POD in the 't::Test::Tech::Tech' module,

    *   generate the 'Tech.d' demo script,

    *   replace the POD demonstration section herein with the demo script
        'Tech.d' output, and

    *   run the test script using Test::Harness with or without the verbose
        option,

    To perform all the above, prepare and run the automation software as
    follows:

    *   Install "Test_STDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz" from one of the
        respositories only if it has not been installed:

        *   http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/

        *   http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

    *   manually place the script tmake.pl in
        "Test_STDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz' in the site operating system
        executable path only if it is not in the executable path

    *   place the 't::Test::Tech::Tech' at the same level in the directory
        struture as the directory holding the 'Test::Tech' module

    *   execute the following in any directory:

         tmake -test_verbose -replace -run -pm=t::Test::Tech::Tech

NOTES
  FILES

    The installation of the "Test-Tech-$VERSION.tar.gz" distribution file
    installs the 'Docs::Site_SVD::Test_Tech' SVD program module.

    The __DATA__ data section of the 'Docs::Site_SVD::Test_Tech' contains
    all the necessary data to generate the POD section of
    'Docs::Site_SVD::Test_Tech' and the "Test-Tech-$VERSION.tar.gz"
    distribution file.

    To make use of the 'Docs::Site_SVD::Test_Tech' SVD program module,
    perform the following:

    *   install "ExtUtils-SVDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz" from one of the
        respositories only if it has not been installed:

        *   http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/

        *   http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

    *   manually place the script vmake.pl in
        "ExtUtils-SVDmaker-$VERSION.tar.gz' in the site operating system
        executable path only if it is not in the executable path

    *   Make any appropriate changes to the __DATA__ section of the
        'Docs::Site_SVD::Test_Tech' module. For example, any changes to
        'File::Package' will impact the at least 'Changes' field.

    *   Execute the following:

         vmake readme_html all -pm=Docs::Site_SVD::Test_Tech

     Test::Tech - Extends the Test program module

     Revision: U

     Version: 0.21

     Date: 2004/04/13

     Classification: NONE

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, program modules, such the "Test::Tech"
    module, extend the Perl language.

    The "Test::Tech" module extends the capabilities of the "Test" module.

    The design is simple. The "Test::Tech" module loads the "Test" module
    without exporting any "Test" subroutines into the "Test::Tech"
    namespace. There is a "Test::Tech" cover subroutine with the same name
    for each "Test" module subroutine. Each "Test::Tech" cover subroutine
    will call the &Test::$subroutine before or after it adds any additional
    capabilities. The "Test::Tech" module is a drop-in for the "Test"
    module.

    The "Test::Tech" module extends the capabilities of the "Test" module as
    follows:

    *   If the compared variables are references, stingifies the referenced
        variable by passing the reference through *Data::Dumper* before
        making the comparison. Thus, Test::Tech can test almost any data
        structure. If the compare variables are not refernces, use the
        &Test::ok and &Test::skip directly.

    *   Adds a method to skip the rest of the tests upon a critical failure

    *   Adds a method to generate demos that appear as an interactive
        session using the methods under test

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases Test::Tech version 0.21 providing description of
    the inventory, installation instructions and other information necessary
    to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes

    Changes are as follows:

    Test-Tester-0.01
        Originated.

    Test-Tester-0.02
        Minor changes to this SVD.

    Test-Tech-0.01
        Due to a non-registered namespace conflict with CPAN, changed the
        namespace from Test::Tester to Test::Tech

    Test-Tech-0.02
        Fixed prototype for &Test::Tech::skip_rest Test::Tech line 84

    Test-Tech-0.03
        The &Data::Dumper::Dumper subroutine stringifies the internal Perl
        variable. Different Perls keep the have different internal formats
        for numbers. Some keep them as binary numbers, while others as
        strings. The ones that keep them as strings may be well spec. In any
        case they have been let loose in the wild so the test scripts that
        use Data::Dumper must deal with them.

        Added a probe to determine how a Perl stores its internal numbers
        and added code to the test script to adjust for the difference in
        Perl

    Test::Tech 0.04
        *   Added functions with the same name as the "Test" functions. This
            make it easier to upgrade from "Test" to "Test::Tech"

        *   Added tests not only for Test 1.15 but also Test 1.24

        *   Added tests for the new "Test" functions.

    Test-Tech-0.05
        Replaced using Test::Util that has disappeared with its
        replacements: File::FileUtil, Test::STD::Scrub, Test::STD::STDutil

    Test-Tech-0.06
        This version changes the previous version but eliminating all object
        methods. Since this module is built on the Test and the Data::Dumper
        modules, neither which are objectified, there is little advantage in
        providing methods where a large number of data is static for all
        objects. In other words, all new objects are mostly same.

    Test-Tech-0.07
        t/Test/Tech/Tech.t t/Test/Tech/techCO.t
            Corrected typos in comments. More info in comments

        Tech::Tech
            Changed the test for TESTERR and Program_lines for setting in
            the tech_p hash from version number to if they are defined.

        File::Util
            Broke "File::FileUtil" apart into modules with more descriptive
            names. Switch to using the new modules "File::Package" and
            "File::SmartNL" instead of "file::FileUtil".

    Test-Tech-0.09
        Left over usage of File::FileUtil in the test script files. Removed
        them. Switch from "Test::STD::Scrub" to "Text::Scrub"

    Test-Tech-0.11
        In the test script, switch to using "Data::Hexdumper" module. Much
        better hex dumper.

    Test-Tech-0.12
        Removed hex dump in test script.

        Change test for begining printout of data, modules used, tec to 1.20
        < Test::VERSION

        Change the test so that test support program modules resides in
        distribution directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory.
        Because they are no longer in the lib directory, test support files
        will not be installed as a pre-condition for the test of this
        module. The test of this module will precede immediately. The test
        support files in the tlib directory will vanish after the
        installtion.

    Test-Tech-0.13
        If there is no diagianotic message and there is a test name, then
        use the test name also for the diagnostic message. Diagnostic
        message appears in brackets after the expected value.

    Test-Tech-0.14
        Broke out the 'stringify' subroutine into its own module:
        'Data::Strify'

        Use Archive::TarGzip 0.02 that uses mode 777 for directories instead
        of 666. Started to get emails from Unix about untar not being able
        to change to a directory with mod of 666.

    Test-Tech-0.15
        Changed from using 'Data::Strify' to 'Data::Secs2' for the stringify
        function. 'Data::Secs2' is useful for SEMI clients and also provides
        sorted hash keys required for comparing stringifcation of Perl's
        nested data. The 'Data::Secs2' obsoletes 'Data::Strify' which is
        history.

        Double checked that PREREQ_PM is 'Data::Secs2' which fixes
        Test-Tech-0.14 error in the PREREQ_PM which errorneous used by
        'Data/Strify.pm' instead of 'Data::Strify'. This should clear
        complain by Mike Castle <dalgoda@ix.netcom.com> that the MakeFile.PL
        for Test-Tech-0.14 crashes with a divide by zero.

        Strange failure from cpan-testers

        Additional comments:

        Hello, Samson Monaco Tutankhamen! Thanks for uploading your works to
        CPAN.

        I noticed that the test suite seem to fail without these modules:
        Data::Secs2

        As such, adding the prerequisite module(s) to 'PREREQ_PM' in your
        Makefile.PL should solve this problem. For example:

        WriteMakefile( AUTHOR => 'Samson Monaco Tutankhamen
        (support@SoftwareDiamonds.com)', ... # other information PREREQ_PM
        => { 'Data::Secs2' => '0', # or a minimum workable version } );

        The PREREQ_PM in the Test-Tech-0.15 MakeFile.PL is as follows:

         PREREQ_PM => {Data::Secs2 => 0.01},

        Changed to

         PREREQ_PM => {'Data::Secs2' => '0.01'},

    Test-Tech-0.17
        The POD was citing &Data::Dumper::Dumper which was replaced by
        Data::Secs2::stringify. Changed the POD over to
        &Data::Secs2::stringify

        The finish() subroutine was in the POD as a subroutine/method but
        not part of @EXPORT_OK. Add it to @EXPORT_OK.

        Redirected all output from the 'Test::' module throught a handle
        Tie. The handle Tie added the test name on the same line as the 'ok'
        'not ok' and collected stats.

        Added printout of the stats to the finish() subroutine.

        Added optional [@options] or {@options} input to the end of the ok
        subroutine and the skip subroutine.

    Test-Tech-0.18
        The test script could not find one of the test library program
        modules. Revamp the test script and test library modules and added
        steps to the ExtUtils::SVDmaker to have the SVDmaker test target run
        tests with just bare @INC that references a vigin Perl installation
        libraries only.

        The lastest build of Test::STDmaker now assumes and expects the test
        library in the same directory as the test script. Coordiated with
        the lastest Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to
        t/Tie, the same directory as the test script and deleting the test
        library File::TestPath program module.

         Summary of my perl5 (revision 5.0 version 8 subversion 0) configuration:
           Platform:
             osname=linux, osvers=2.4.22-4tr, archname=i586-linux

        This is capitalization problem. The program module name is 'FindBin'
        not 'FindBIN' which is part of Perl. Microsoft does not care about
        capitalization differences while linux does. This error is in the
        test script automatically generated by "Test::STDmaker" and was just
        introduced when moved test script libraries from "tlib" to the
        directory of the test script. Repaired "Test::STDmaker" and
        regenerated the distribution.

        [snip]

        Can't locate Data/Secs2.pm in @INC

        [snip]

        As such, adding the prerequisite module(s) to 'PREREQ_PM' in your
        Makefile.PL should solve this problem. For example:

         WriteMakefile(
             AUTHOR      => 'Samson Monaco Tutankhamen (support@SoftwareDiamonds.com)',
             ... # other information
             PREREQ_PM   => {
                'Data::Secs2'   => '0', # or a minimum workable version
             }
         );

        [snip]

        CORRECTIVE ACTION:

        An exam of MakeFile.PL revealed the following:

         WriteMakefile(
            # [snip]
            PREREQ_PM => {'Data::Secs2' => '0.01'},
            # [snip]
         );

        Cannot see anything wrong with the PREREQ_PM statement. The only
        possibilities that come to mind are either CPAN not processing the
        prereq_pm properly, same syntax problem with "PREREQ_PM " or because
        the test script uses "Test::Tech" to test "Test::Tech", the prereq
        is processed too late.

        Added "Data::Secs2" to the test library so the test will run.

    Test-Tech-0.21
        For "Test" module, version 1.20 or greater, changed so it sents
        failure messages when skip flag turned on for "&Test::Tech::ok" and
        "&Test::Tech::ok" out "$Test::TESTERR" instead of "$Test::TESTOUT".

        For "&Test::Tech::finish" automatically generate failure messages
        for all missing (not performed) test when the skip rest of tests
        flag is on.

        The "FindBIN" that runs fine on Win because Win file spec is case
        insensitive and Unix whats case sensitive "FindBin" was fixed with
        on test "Test::Test". However, overlooked all the test scripts that
        the top test script runs, grabs the output and compares to expected
        ouput stored in files. Corrected the "FindBin" for following test
        software: "TechA0.t TechB0.t TechC0.t TechD0.d TechE0.t"

        the following repositories in a web browser:

          http://www.softwarediamonds/packages/
          http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/S/SO/SOFTDIA/

        Right click on 'Test-Tech-0.21.tar.gz' and download to a temporary
        installation directory. Enter the following where $make is 'nmake'
        for microsoft windows; otherwise 'make'.

         gunzip Test-Tech-0.21.tar.gz
         tar -xf Test-Tech-0.21.tar

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    Known issues are as follows:

    Merge with the "Test" module
        The "Test::Tech" capabilites could be incorporated into the "Test"
        program module and "Test::Tech" eliminated.

    TestLevel and Program_Lines
        The "Test" module does not take the *$TestLevel* value into account
        where it chooses the module to load the *%Program_Line* hash. Since
        the the Test::Tech manpage module adds a module layer in between the
        the Test manpage module that the test script, the *$TestLevel* must
        be set to 1. Thus, the the Test manpage module loads the the
        Test::Tech manpage module into *%Program_Line* hash instead of the
        Module Under Test.
