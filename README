1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification
    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview
    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, program modules, such the "Test::Tech"
    module, extend the Perl language.

    The "Test::Tech" module extends the capabilities of the "Test" module.

    The design is simple. The "Test::Tech" module loads the "Test" module
    without exporting any "Test" subroutines into the "Test::Tech"
    namespace. There is a "Test::Tech" cover subroutine with the same name
    for each "Test" module subroutine. Each "Test::Tech" cover subroutine
    will call the &Test::$subroutine before or after it adds any additional
    capabilities. The "Test::Tech" module is a drop-in for the "Test"
    module.

    The "Test::Tech" module extends the capabilities of the "Test" module as
    follows:

    *   If the compared variables are references, stingifies the referenced
        variable by passing the reference through *Data::Dumper* before
        making the comparison. Thus, Test::Tech can test almost any data
        structure. If the compare variables are not refernces, use the
        &Test::ok and &Test::skip directly.

    *   Adds a method to skip the rest of the tests upon a critical failure

    *   Adds a method to generate demos that appear as an interactive
        session using the methods under test

  1.3 Document overview.
    This document releases Test::Tech version 0.17 providing description of
    the inventory, installation instructions and other information necessary
    to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes
    Changes are as follows:

    Test-Tester-0.01
        Originated.

    Test-Tester-0.02
        Minor changes to this SVD.

    Test-Tech-0.01
        Due to a non-registered namespace conflict with CPAN, changed the
        namespace from Test::Tester to Test::Tech

    Test-Tech-0.02
        Fixed prototype for &Test::Tech::skip_rest Test::Tech line 84

    Test-Tech-0.03
        The &Data::Dumper::Dumper subroutine stringifies the internal Perl
        variable. Different Perls keep the have different internal formats
        for numbers. Some keep them as binary numbers, while others as
        strings. The ones that keep them as strings may be well spec. In any
        case they have been let loose in the wild so the test scripts that
        use Data::Dumper must deal with them.

        Added a probe to determine how a Perl stores its internal numbers
        and added code to the test script to adjust for the difference in
        Perl

    Test::Tech 0.04

        *   Added functions with the same name as the "Test" functions. This
            make it easier to upgrade from "Test" to "Test::Tech"

        *   Added tests not only for Test 1.15 but also Test 1.24

        *   Added tests for the new "Test" functions.

    Test-Tech-0.05
        Replaced using Test::Util that has disappeared with its
        replacements: File::FileUtil, Test::STD::Scrub, Test::STD::STDutil

    Test-Tech-0.06
        This version changes the previous version but eliminating all object
        methods. Since this module is built on the Test and the Data::Dumper
        modules, neither which are objectified, there is little advantage in
        providing methods where a large number of data is static for all
        objects. In other words, all new objects are mostly same.

    Test-Tech-0.07

        t/Test/Tech/Tech.t t/Test/Tech/techCO.t
            Corrected typos in comments. More info in comments

        Tech::Tech
            Changed the test for TESTERR and Program_lines for setting in
            the tech_p hash from version number to if they are defined.

        File::Util
            Broke "File::FileUtil" apart into modules with more descriptive
            names. Switch to using the new modules "File::Package" and
            "File::SmartNL" instead of "file::FileUtil".

    Test-Tech-0.09
        Left over usage of File::FileUtil in the test script files. Removed
        them. Switch from "Test::STD::Scrub" to "Text::Scrub"

    Test-Tech-0.11
        In the test script, switch to using "Data::Hexdumper" module. Much
        better hex dumper.

    Test-Tech-0.12
        Removed hex dump in test script.

        Change test for begining printout of data, modules used, tec to 1.20
        < Test::VERSION

        Change the test so that test support program modules resides in
        distribution directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory.
        Because they are no longer in the lib directory, test support files
        will not be installed as a pre-condition for the test of this
        module. The test of this module will precede immediately. The test
        support files in the tlib directory will vanish after the
        installtion.

    Test-Tech-0.13
        If there is no diagianotic message and there is a test name, then
        use the test name also for the diagnostic message. Diagnostic
        message appears in brackets after the expected value.

    Test-Tech-0.14
        Broke out the 'stringify' subroutine into its own module:
        'Data::Strify'

        Use Archive::TarGzip 0.02 that uses mode 777 for directories instead
        of 666. Started to get emails from Unix about untar not being able
        to change to a directory with mod of 666.

    Test-Tech-0.15
        Changed from using 'Data::Strify' to 'Data::Secs2' for the stringify
        function. 'Data::Secs2' is useful for SEMI clients and also provides
        sorted hash keys required for comparing stringifcation of Perl's
        nested data. The 'Data::Secs2' obsoletes 'Data::Strify' which is
        history.

        Double checked that PREREQ_PM is 'Data::Secs2' which fixes
        Test-Tech-0.14 error in the PREREQ_PM which errorneous used by
        'Data/Strify.pm' instead of 'Data::Strify'. This should clear
        complain by Mike Castle <dalgoda@ix.netcom.com> that the MakeFile.PL
        for Test-Tech-0.14 crashes with a divide by zero.

    Test-Tech-0.16
        Strange failure from cpan-testers

         Cc: SOFTDIA@cpan.org
         Subject: FAIL Test-Tech-0.15 sun4-solaris 2.8
         To: cpan-testers@perl.org 

        Additional comments:

        Hello, Samson Monaco Tutankhamen! Thanks for uploading your works to
        CPAN.

        I noticed that the test suite seem to fail without these modules:
        Data::Secs2

        As such, adding the prerequisite module(s) to 'PREREQ_PM' in your
        Makefile.PL should solve this problem. For example:

        WriteMakefile( AUTHOR => 'Samson Monaco Tutankhamen
        (support@SoftwareDiamonds.com)', ... # other information PREREQ_PM
        => { 'Data::Secs2' => '0', # or a minimum workable version } );

        The PREREQ_PM in the Test-Tech-0.15 MakeFile.PL is as follows:

         PREREQ_PM => {Data::Secs2 => 0.01},

        Changed to

         PREREQ_PM => {'Data::Secs2' => '0.01'},

    Test-Tech-0.17
        The POD was citing &Data::Dumper::Dumper which was replaced by
        Data::Secs2::stringify. Changed the POD over to
        &Data::Secs2::stringify

        The finish() subroutine was in the POD as a subroutine/method but
        not part of @EXPORT_OK. Add it to @EXPORT_OK.

        Redirected all output from the 'Test::' module throught a handle
        Tie. The handle Tie added the test name on the same line as the 'ok'
        'not ok' and collected stats.

        Added printout of the stats to the finish() subroutine.

        Added optional [@options] or {@options} input to the end of the ok
        subroutine and the skip subroutine.

  3.4 Adaptation data.
    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. There are no other additional
    requirements or tailoring needed of configurations files, adaptation
    data or other software needed for this installation particular to any
    installation site.

        installation contact

         603 882-0846 E<lt>support@SoftwareDiamonds.comE<gt>

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors
    Known issues are as follows:

    Merge with the "Test" module
        The "Test::Tech" capabilites could be incorporated into the "Test"
        program module and "Test::Tech" eliminated.

    TestLevel and Program_Lines
        The "Test" module does not take the *$TestLevel* value into account
        where it chooses the module to load the *%Program_Line* hash. Since
        the Test::Tech module adds a module layer in between the Test module
        that the test script, the *$TestLevel* must be set to 1. Thus, the
        Test module loads the Test::Tech module into *%Program_Line* hash
        instead of the Module Under Test.

    "Data::Dumper" stringification is not portable
        For numeric arrays, "Data::Dumper" module will not stringify them
        the same for all Perls. The below Perl code will produce different
        results for different Perls

         $probe = 3;
         $actual = Dumper([0+$probe]);

        For Perl v5.6.1 MSWin32-x86-multi-thread, ActiveState build 631,
        binary, the results will be '[\'3\']' while for Perl version 5.008
        for solaris the results will be '[3]'.

        The '[\'3\']' results is probable wrong, and the Perls that produce
        them are mutants that should be hunted down and killed.
