1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Indentification

    This release is a collection of Perl modules that extend the
    capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. The system does
    not have any hardware. The Perl programming language contains two
    features that are utilized by this release:

    1   Program Modules to extend the languages

    2   Plain Old Documentation (POD) that may be embedded in the language

    These features are established by the referenced documents.

    The Test::Tech module extends the capabilities of the Test module as
    follows:

    *   Correctly compares almost any data structure by passing the
        variables through *Data::Dumper* before making the comparision

    *   Adds a method to skip the rest of the tests upon a critical failure

    *   Adds a method to generate demos that appear as an interactive
        session using the methods under test

    *   Inherits the methods from the Test::Util module

    The Test::Tech module is an integral part of the US DOD SDT2167A bundle
    of modules. The dependency of the program modules in the US DOD STD2167A
    bundle is as follows:

     Test::TestUtil
         Test::Tech
            DataPort::FileType::FormDB DataPort::DataFile
                Test::STDmaker ExtUtils::SVDmaker

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases Test::Tech version 0.03 providing description of
    the inventory, installation instructions and other information necessary
    to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes

    The &Data::Dumper::Dumper subroutine stringifies the iternal Perl
    variable. Different Perls keep the have different internal formats for
    numbers. Some keep them as binary numbers, while others as strings. The
    ones that keep them as strings may be well spec. In any case they have
    been let loose in the wild so the test scripts that use Data::Dumper
    must deal with them.

    Added a probe to determine how a Perl stores its internal numbers and
    added code to the test script to adjust for the difference in Perl

  3.4 Adaptation data.

    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. Installation sites running Microsoft
    Operating systems require the installation of Unix utilities. An
    excellent, highly recommended Unix utilities for Microsoft operating
    systems is unxutils by Karl M. Syring. A copy is available at the
    following web sites:

     http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
